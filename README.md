# Sparks - Screen Saver
Sparks is a small, lightweight, work-in-progress screen saver for OS X.

The main impetus was testing Xcode 5 and that I couldn't sleep on my flight. I did update the code for ARC. No Xcode 5 or 10.9-specific features are used, so, this does compile and run on 10.8 (tested, but not on anything earlier).

I'll get some binary downloads available soon.
